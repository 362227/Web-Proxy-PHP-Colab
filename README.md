# Web-Proxy-PHP-Colab
Run a web proxy written in PHP through Google Colab made by [Deviper-Labs](https://github.com/Deviper-Labs)

## Note:
The actual proxy was created by [Athlon1600](https://github.com/Athlon1600), called [php-proxy](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy-app)

This notebook is just a way of using and setting up the same proxy on an online runtime via [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory) and tunnelling it to an open server accessible from any device through the given URL
